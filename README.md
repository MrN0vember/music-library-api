# Music Library API
In the following 2 weeks, we'll be applying our knowledge of databases by using what we have learned to build a Music Library API.

To get our express app talking to our MySQL database, we will be using Sequelize. Sequelize is an ORM (object relational model) for SQL databases. An ORM is a tool which lets us interact with a system which has different primitive types. Sequelize takes care of communicating with our database, and converting our JavaScript data into something MySQL can store.

## Learning objectives:
To be able to answer "yes" to the following questions:

Can you explain what a data schema is?
Can you design and implement an API with CRUD operations on a database?
Concepts
Databases
Database Design
SQL
MySQL
Sequelize
Database Querying and CRUD operations

## Challenge:
For the next 2 weeks you are going to be building a Music Library API. It will store information about artists, albums and songs. We will implement a CRUD REST API to interact with a MySQL database.

For this project, you'll be firing up an instance of MySQL locally to use with your Express API.

Once you've got your MySQL instance set-up, you'll implement a REST API which will let you perform Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) actions on artists, albums and songs.
